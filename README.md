# 2min.fit

## Background
I created this app primary for my own personal use. I found that as a personal trainer turned software engineer, I was spending much more time sitting at a desk than I was used to, and I wanted to create a way to implement some more movement into the work day. 

### What is it?
2 Minute Fit is a productivity/health application that provides users with daily exercises to complete between meetings or during other breaks while working at a desk. While 2 Minute Fit is not a substitute for a regular daily exercise routine, it is certainly effective in mitigating the negative effects of sitting for long hours in front of the computer. 

Each day of the work week, 2 Minute Fit provides three exercises, 2 strength exercises and 1 stretching exercise to complete whenever the user deems necessary (I recommend every hour or so). Each day of the week has different exercises, and the exercises complement each other to ensure that all muscle groups are exercised throughout the week. 

As a user, you are also able to select from different programs. Currently, there is an offering of the original exercises as well as a modified program using exercises from Ben Patrick's popular ATG program.

### How do you use it?
I recommend simply having the app open in a browser tab and going through a round after a meetings or implemented in a Pomodoro Timer regimen (performing the exercises during the 5 minute Pomodoro breaks). The app is simple to use, with a small set of instructions available upon the app opening. 

## Plans for Version 1.1
- Updates exercise program to include Beginner, Intermediate, and Expert
- Options for users using the app on the weekend (currently it only supports M-F)
